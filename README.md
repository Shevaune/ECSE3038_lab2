# ECSE3038_lab2
# Aim of Lab
This lab is an exercise which is aimed to get students more accustomed to the different technologies used in designing and implementing a RESTful API server.
# Program Description
This project will be used to manage a system that monitors the status of a set of electronically measured water tanks. The embedded circuit that is attached to each water tank will measure the height of the water in the tank and report on the tank's current occupancy as a percentage of its maximum capacity.
# Requirements 
1. It is required to design a RESTful API which allows each IoT enabled water tank to interface with the server so that the measured values can be represented visually on a web page. 
2. The API should also support the maintenance of a simple user profile.
3. The server should be able to perform the actions of a simple HTTP web server. The server should be able to perform actions on a resource such as Create, Read, Update and Delete which is to be done without the use of a database.
4. The server should be designed to host at least 7 specific HTTP routes.
